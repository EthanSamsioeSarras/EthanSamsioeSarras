## Hey there ♠️

I'm Ethan, a video game development student at DSV Stockholm University.

I love a good programming challenge!

If I don't know how to execute an idea, it only motivates me further to find the solution.

My main tech stack includes Unreal Engine, Unity, Visual Studio, and VS Code, where my primary languages are C# and C/C++.
