# Hey there ♠️

**I'm Ethan, a video game development student at DSV Stockholm University.**

I love a good programming challenge! <br/>  
If I don't know how to execute an idea, it only motivates me further to find the solution.

### Tech Stack

My main tech stack includes Unreal Engine, Unity, Visual Studio, and VS Code, where my primary languages are C# and C/C++.
