# Hey there

**I'm Ethan, a video game development student at DSV Stockholm University.** <br/>
**I love a good programming challenge! If I don't know how to execute an idea, it only motivates me further to find the solution.**

### Tech Stack

My main tech stack includes **Unreal Engine, Unity, Visual Studio, and VS Code**, where my primary languages are **C#** and **C/C++.**
